## Business Understanding

The purpose of this project is to analyze user interactions and predict potential future purchases. This aligns with business goals such as increasing customer retention, optimizing marketing strategies, and improving sales conversions.

## Dataset

**Source:** Kaggle dataset  
**Description:** The dataset includes user behavior data with features such as browsing history, time spent on pages, and past purchases.

### Preprocessing Steps

- Handling missing values
- Feature engineering
- Data normalization

## Machine Learning Pipeline

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling.
- **Feature Selection:** Identifying key variables influencing predictions.
- **Model Selection:** Using regression or classification models based on business needs.
- **Training & Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimizing model performance.
- **Evaluation:** Assessing model accuracy and reliability.

## Data Visualization

Key insights will be represented using:

- Correlation heatmaps
- Distribution plots
- Feature importance graphs
- Actual vs. Predicted plots

## Dashboard

Built using **Streamlit**, the dashboard provides

- An interactive interface for data exploration
- A visualization of key findings
- Model predictions with confidence scores
